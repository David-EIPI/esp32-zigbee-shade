# esp32-zigbee-shade

## Overview

The purpose of this external window shade is to screen the room from the sun, thus reducing the load on the air conditioner. I have upgraded a basic corded rollershade with a small DC motor and a Zigbee controller integrated into my Homeassistant network.

## Hardware

This window cover is based on VICLLAX 5x6ft corded rollup shade. This model uses aluminum tube with inner diameter of 1 1/8" (28mm).
